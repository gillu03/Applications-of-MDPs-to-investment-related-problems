# Applications-of-MDPs-to-investment-related-problems

# Project Title

## Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for the dissertation titled **"Applications of MDPs to investment-related problems"**. 
The project explores optimal consumption and investment strategies under different utility functions (Power and Exponential) using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
The code is used for Chapter 6 - Numerical Example to obtain the tables and graphs presented in this chapter.

## 6. Numerical Example

### 6.1 Power Utility
A numerical example demonstrating the application of the Power utility function in consumption and investment.

### 6.2 Exponential Utility
This section presents a numerical example with the Exponential utility function.

### 6.3 Power Utility vs. Exponential Utility
A comparative analysis of the results obtained from the Power and Exponential utility functions.
